# GovernSafe React JS Assessment

## Congratulations!

We are delighted to invite you to participate in the React JS assessment for your internship at GovernSafe. This assessment is an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and creativity by implementing a dynamic UI component in React JS.

## Assignment Details

**Task:** Your task is to create an animated React JS component based on the `onboarding.gif` design provided. This component should mimic the animation and visual appeal of the gif, demonstrating your ability to translate designs into functional React components.

**Objective:** The goal of this assignment is to assess your proficiency in React JS, including your understanding of state management, component lifecycle, and animation integration in web applications.

## Requirements

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   - Begin by forking this repository to your GitHub account and then clone it to your local development environment.

2. **Create the React Component:**

   - Translate the `onboarding.gif` animation into a React component.
   - Ensure that the animation is smooth and closely matches the original gif.

3. **React Specifications:**

   - Use the latest stable version of React.
   - Utilize functional components and hooks for state management and lifecycle events.
   - You may use third-party libraries like `Framer Motion` or `React Spring` for animation effects if necessary.

4. **Styling:**

   - The visual style and dimensions of the animated component must closely resemble those in the provided gif.
   - You can use CSS or styled-components for styling (preferably styled-components for better styling encapsulation).

5. **Documentation:**

   - Provide a `README.md` file in your repository that includes:
     - An overview of your project.
     - Any additional notes or dependencies required to run your project.

6. **Submission:**
   - Once completed, push your changes to your forked repository and submit a pull request to the original `GovernSafe` assessment repository.
   - Include a brief description of your implementation and any challenges you faced.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality:** The component should function as intended and replicate the animation and design specified in the gif.
- **Code Quality:** Code should be clean, well-organized, and properly commented.
- **Animation Smoothness:** The animation should be smooth and visually appealing.
- **Creativity and Innovation:** Creative solutions and techniques to achieve the desired outcome are highly encouraged.

## Getting Started
